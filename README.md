## Technologies used
* ReactJs
* JavaScript
* Ruby on Rails
* Mongoid(ODM)
* MongoDB


## Scope
I am going to build a job board app for coding bootcamp graduates. It will have 2 types of users, companies and job seekers. Companies will be able to post jobs and browse profiles of the job seekers. Job Seekers will be able to build a candidate profile and search & apply for jobs. The API will be built in Rails and front-end will use ReactJs  library to render the application to UI. For job seekers, I will give the user an option to connect to codewars.com account using the CodeWars API.

## Planning

Plan:
1. write and test code for each feature or user story before moving on to next feature (BackEnd)
2. Make an outline of each component
3. write and test each component
4. Add Styling with css

Goals
[]Make it a single page app
[]Build and deploy job board api using Rails and MongoDB
[]Create a simple components with React
[]Keep code modular(separate concerns)
